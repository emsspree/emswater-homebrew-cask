üö∞ Water for Homebrew
=====================

**A Tap for üç∫ Homebrew, the missing package manager for macOS (or Linux).**

[![brew.sh](https://img.shields.io/badge/WWW-brew.sh-yellow?logo=homebrew&logoColor=white&labelColor=gray)](https://brew.sh/)
[![github.com/Homebrew](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Homebrew%2F‚Ä¶-yellow?logo=github&labelColor=gray)](https://github.com/Homebrew)

To add this tap, run:

    brew tap emsspree/homebrew-water

This [Tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) is still pretty dry.

I don't plan to offer alternatives to existing Homebrew packages. If I create formulas and casks that are also offered by another third party, it is pure coincidence. In such a case, I would very likely be inclined to merge to achieve the best possible solution.

The packages that I will offer here are currently not interesting enough for inclusion in [Homebrew Core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) or [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask). Nevertheless, I consciously choose longer names than necessary to avoid installation conflicts or other problems in case the packages are taken over once.

## FAQ

Why ‚ÄúWater‚Äù? Isn't that pretty presumptuous?

+ My username consists of the names of two rivers, [Ems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ems_(river)) and [Spree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spree_(river)). I imagined it was funny somehow.
